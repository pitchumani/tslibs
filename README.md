# TSLIBS : Thread safe libraries
## Idea for Thread-Safe Data Structures:
**Concept:** Implement thread-safe versions of common data structures (e.g., queue, stack, map) using mutexes and condition variables.

**Multithreading:** Ensure concurrent access to the data structure is synchronized to avoid data races and inconsistencies.

**Design Patterns:**
- Monitor Object: Use a monitor object (like a mutex with condition variables) to protect access to the shared data structure.
